# daily-achievement-monitor
A SPA that monitors my personal daily actions, learnings, spent, and time-usage to achieve more productive life;D
Planning to display this on a wall-mounted monitor in my room.
Since this contains personal data, the accounts and passwords needed to display charts are not synced with git.

## Architecture overview
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Frontend: React.js + Chart.js
- APIs: twitter, github, citibank, Nokia health mate
